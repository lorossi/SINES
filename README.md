# SINES

## But first, some background

*Well, there's none.* Honestly I'm running out of my writing creativity. I am starting to get really envious of people who can write coherent and non-repetitive description for each project.

Probably the whole issue has to be found in my workflow, described by these simple steps:

1. Have an idea
1. Try to code it
1. Realize that I don't like it
1. Go to 2 and repeat until I am satisfied
1. Export as a video
1. Procrastinate for months **IMPORTANT**
1. Write a semi-decent README and make the repo public
1. Wait (as in procrastinate) for a few more months **IMPORTANT**
1. Publish the rendered images and video on my [Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/lorossi97/)

If I only wrote my READMEs while creating the project, I would save myself from this tedious process that I hate.

But here we go again, staring at an empty screen. Is really that important to write a README?

## Are you ok?

Yes. I just hate writing READMEs, that's all. Usually I would say something about the technology or some details about the implementations, but there's none. It's just an HTML5 canvas element on which I draw using [a custom boilerplate that I am developing.](https://github.com/lorossi/empty-html5-canvas-project)

It's just a series of sines drawn with some interval, looped over a period of frames. I would provide a link to run this on your own computer but it has no interactivity so it doesn't too much sense. If you really want to try this in your browser, just clone the repo and run in your machine.

I'm going to leap to C++ because it takes way too much time to render this kinds of videos.

## Lame. Where do I see this video?

On my [Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/lorossi97/) or on a super choppy, compressed, low-frameratey, heavy as hell GIF here below. You can always clone the repo and view the source video in the `output` folder.
